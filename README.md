## My process

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology
- Minified documents

### Useful resources

- [BEM Methodology](https://9elements.com/bem-cheat-sheet/) - This helps me to know where exactly I'm working on so I don't have to create classes with some weird names haha.
- [Normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This file makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. It precisely targets only the styles that need normalizing.
- [HTML Minifier](https://codebeautify.org/minify-html) - This page helps to have all your html document written in a single line.
- [CSS Minifier](https://cssminifier.org/) - This page helps to have all your css document written in a single line.

## Acknowledgments

I have to say thank you to [AlexCG Design](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/3oFZo-MDJtI), whithout you this design wouldn't be possible. I didn't know anything about the `::after` pseudo-element and the importance of using it on this challenge. I used it when the user hovers over the image and the view icon just appears. I really really owe you one!
